250 directories
Human DNA-related files (SAM, BAM, and BED) in the 'human' directory are created once per sub-project and remain unchanged across runs.
Intermediate metagenomic files in the 'metagenomic' directory are overwritten with each run and should be inspected beforehand if desired.
Results are stored in the 'results' directory (including FastQC, host DNA analysis, and run-specific results like Kraken2 and Bracken).

================================================= METAGENOMIC ABUNDANCE ESTIMATION =================================================
⚠️  This step assumes reads have already been trimmed with Trimmomatic and host DNA removed with Bowtie2. Processed reads must be in the correct directory.
